# Team Generator Application

# Description

This application uses node.js and object oriented programming to generate a webpage. When the application is launched, the user will be prompted to enter a manager's name, id, and email address. The user is then prompted to enter the team that reports to that manager. Once the user is finished entering the data, the application generates the webpage that will contain all the info entered.
